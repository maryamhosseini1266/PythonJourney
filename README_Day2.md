# Day 2 - Data Visualization

## Project Description
In this project, I visualized data using Python. After performing basic data analysis in Day 1, the goal of Day 2 was to represent the data visually using charts. Data visualization helps make information easier to understand and compare.

## Tasks
- Load data from a CSV file
- Analyze the data by grouping values
- Calculate averages
- Create charts to visualize the data

## What I Learned
- How to use matplotlib for plotting
- How to visualize data using charts
- How to make data easier to understand visually
- How to combine pandas and matplotlib

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Files
- day2.py
- data2.csv

## Result
The result of this project is a chart that shows the distribution and comparison of data values. This makes it easier to see patterns and differences in the dataset.

## Next Step
The next step is to combine data analysis and visualization into a small complete project.
